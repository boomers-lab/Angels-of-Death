		<description>An armored personnel carrier used by the Adeptus Astartes, as well as other elite Imperial forces. Its ten passengers are covered by a Storm Bolter mounted on top of the vehicle. \n\nThe Rhino dates back all the way to the Dark Age of Technology, where it was used to explore newly-colonized planets and transport troops into combat. When an STC fragment for it was recovered, it was quickly adopted by the Imperium of Man. \n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Gunner x1, Passenger x10\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</description>
